# OddParity-bit-Generator-using-FSM
This project implements an Odd Parity Bit Generator using a Finite State Machine (FSM). The FSM monitors incoming serial data bits and updates its state to track parity. When transmission ends, the circuit outputs a parity bit ensuring the total number of 1s is odd.
